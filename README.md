Why the software magicians guys don't have an newsletter?  


# Roadmap

- Given a list of URLs and a user email, scrape those URLs and associate them with the email
- Save the results of the web scrape into a MongoDB to create the comparison logic
- Create a scheduler mechanism that will activate the scrape and comparison logic
- Trigger an email mechanism to send messages to the users when they favorite author publish something new 🏖️
